Runtype is a collection of run-time type utilities for Python.

It is:

üèÉ Fast! (benchmarks coming soon)

üß† Smart! Supports typing, constraints, auto-casting, and much more.

‚öôÔ∏è Very customizable. You can use dataclass and dispatch with your own typesystem!

Modules
‚≠ê validation - Provides a smarter alternative to isinstance and issubclass

    Supports typing module, and type constraints.

‚≠ê dataclass - Adds run-time type validation to the built-in dataclass.

    Improves dataclass ergonomics.
    Supports automatic value casting, Pydantic-style. (Optional, off by default)
    Supports types with constraints. (e.g. String(max_length=10))

‚≠ê dispatch - Provides fast multiple-dispatch for functions and methods, via a decorator.

    Inspired by Julia.

‚≠ê base_types - Provides a set of classes to implement your own type-system.

    Used by runtype itself, to emulate the Python type-system.
